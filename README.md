## Description
As you may recognise, on a fully updated Windows 8.1, your profile picture won‚Äôt show on the logon screen. That means if you start your PC, or want to log in after logging off, or even when you just locked your PC, there will be only a generic user icon instead of your profile picture:

That‚Äôs where this tool comes handy, designed and written fully by me üòÑ It‚Äôll add a missing registry key called ‚ÄúImage200‚Äù where the path to the image file, which shows the profile picture on the logon screen, is being stored.

Look at that, much better!
